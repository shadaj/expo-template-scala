# Scala.js + Slinky Expo Template
This template sets up a simple React Native application written in Scala through [Scala.js](https://www.scala-js.org), [Slinky](https://slinky.dev), and [Expo](https://expo.io).

## Installation
Install the Expo CLI:
```
$ npm install -g expo-cli
```

Use the template. Move inside the `expo-template-scala` directory and run:
```
$ expo init --template expo-template-scala
```

## Building Apps
Once you've created your project, move inside the newly created directory (named as you choose in the previous step) and first compile your Scala code to JavaScript by running
```
$ sbt fastOptJS
```

Then, launch the app with Expo
```
$ expo start
```

## Production Bundles
To create a minified app, first build an optimized Scala.js bundle
```
$ sbt fullOptJS
```

Then, go to `App.js` and uncomment `module.exports = require("./target/scala-2.12/app-opt.js").app;` in order to enable the production bundle. Finally, switch Expo to production mode to load your production app.
